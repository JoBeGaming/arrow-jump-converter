# arrow-jump-converter
Convert any Assembly like language, where addresses are covered by placeholders like `[address]`. The placeholder, comment starting symbol and all instructions that can jump will can be set in `main.py`.  
*Note that the code is not checked for validity*

Known limitations 
> - Comments are **not** supported
> - Invalid Syntax is **not** brought up
> - In some cases the 'depth' might be calculated incorrectly, but this **will** be fixed soon. <!--Actually fix this lol-->
